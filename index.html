            <div class= "about-me">
            <p>
              I am from Dallas, Texas. Went to college at Whitworth University and Hendrix college
              where I was a member of the men's basketball team.
              After graduation, I started my career in coaching at the high school level then quickly moved into college basketball coaching.
              After the pandemic hit, I decided that I needed to pursue my passion which has always been
              coding which has brought me to SMU Coding Bootcamp. Here you will be able to see the work that
              I have made recently. I hope to work in the web developent industy as it has always been a goal of mine to learn how to code.
              Currently taking classes at Southern Methodist University to help me get where I want to go.
